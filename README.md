# Image Editor

There's not much to say; it's just an image editor that permits the user to modify an image:

## Features
- **Colors:** You can modify the colors of the image (RGB).
- **Invert Colors:** You can invert the image's colors.
- **Orientation:** You can now change the orientation.

## TODO
- Rotate the image in all directions.
- Add other color inversion methods (other than invert).
